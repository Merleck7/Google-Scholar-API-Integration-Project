# Google Scholar API Integration Project

## 📌 Project Purpose
The main goal of this project is to automate the integration of information about university researchers and their published articles.  
By using the **Google Scholar API**, this system enables efficient retrieval and management of relevant data that will be integrated into the institution’s research database.

## ⚙️ Key Functionalities
- Retrieve data about **researchers, publications, and citations** from Google Scholar.  
- Apply the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** design pattern for clean and modular Java code.  
- Store and manage retrieved data in a structured **relational database**.  
- Handle **pagination, errors, and API limits** during integration.  
- Provide technical documentation and usage examples.  

## 🎯 Project Relevance
Research institutions require efficient ways to consolidate and analyze information about their researchers’ academic output.  
This project simplifies the process by:
- Automating data collection from Google Scholar.  
- Reducing manual work in curating academic data.  
- Ensuring that the research database remains **updated and consistent**.  

## 📄 Documentation
A complete **Technical Report on the Google Scholar API** is included in this repository, covering:
- Endpoints  
- Authentication methods  
- Query parameters  
- Response formats  
- Usage limits  
- Code examples  

## 🔑 Access Permissions
The repository has been configured with the appropriate access permissions to allow the **Digital NAO evaluation team** to easily review all deliverables.
